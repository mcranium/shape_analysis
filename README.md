## Functionality

Added functionality: Object oriented programming style instead of Jupyter notebooks & Multi-core processing.

What works so far: Calculation of vector dispersion and cube counting fractal dimension calculation.

What is still missing: Volumetric fractal dimension calculation, ...

Dependencies: Python 3.9.2 (exact version is likely not important), for python packages see [shape_analysis.py](shape_analysis.py).
